Overview

This project demonstrates how to implement user authentication in a Node.js application using Passport.js with Google OAuth 2.0. It allows users to log in with their Google account, and the application securely handles user sessions.

Features

	•	Google OAuth Authentication: Users can sign in using their Google account.
	•	Secure Sessions: User sessions are managed securely with express-session.
	•	User Profile Handling: The application retrieves and stores basic user information from Google, such as their name and email.
	•	Logout Functionality: Users can easily log out of the application.
	•	Simple UI: A basic user interface to demonstrate the authentication flow.

Prerequisites

	•	Node.js installed
	•	npm or yarn for package management
	•	A Google account for OAuth setup
	•	ngrok (optional for local testing with a public callback URL)
